# Responsive
## About
This is a projet to study how to make responsive web pages. The code here was made following the course [**Conquering Responsive Layouts**](https://courses.kevinpowell.co/courses/conquering-responsive-layouts) by **Kevim powell**. It's a 21 day course where Kevin teach us techniques to build mobile fist web pages using flexbox and CSS Grid. 
## Main Objective
During the course I was supposed to follow some challenges every day to help me learn responsive design concepts and good practices. The projetct is still online and it's not over yet. 
## My personal changes
I made some changes in the code like class names, colors and CSS choices. But the final result is amost the same.
